FUSE for macOS
==============

FUSE for macOS allows you to extend macOS via third party file systems.

About FUSE for macOS
--------------------

The FUSE for macOS software package provides multiple APIs for developing file systems for OS X 10.9 to macOS 10.12. It is a successor to [MacFUSE](http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/), which has been the basis of many products, but is no longer being maintained.

You can use the provided APIs to develop numerous types of file systems, whose content can come from a local disk, from across the network, from memory, or any other source. One of these APIs is a superset of the [FUSE API](http://fuse.sourceforge.net/), that originated on Linux.

Due to the fact that FUSE file systems are regular applications (as opposed to kernel extensions), you have just as much flexibility and choice in programming tools, debuggers, and libraries as you have if you were developing standard macOS applications.

Build Instructions
------------------

The build script automatically locates all supported installations of Xcode in your Applications folder. It builds a distribution package compatible with the currently running version of macOS.

---

**Note:**

* Xcode 4.3 and newer versions do not include autotools and libtool, that are needed to build `libosxfuse`. Install MacPorts or Homebrew and run the following commands in Terminal to install the required tools:

 MacPorts:

        sudo port install autoconf automake libtool gettext

 Homebrew:

        brew install autoconf automake libtool gettext
        brew link --force gettext

* The "Command Line Tools" package is needed to generate BridgeSupport metadata for `OSXFUSE.framework` because of a bug in `gen_bridge_metadata` (hard coded path to `cpp`).

The Xcode tools packages can be obtained from https://developer.apple.com/downloads/ (free Apple Developer ID required).

To clone the source repository into a newly created subdirectory named `osxfuse` in the current working directory, run the following command in Terminal:

    git clone --recursive -b support/osxfuse-3 git://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse.git osxfuse

Run the following command in the cloned repository to build FUSE for macOS from source:

    ./build.sh -t distribution
    
The resulting distribution package can be found in `/tmp/osxfuse/distribution`.
